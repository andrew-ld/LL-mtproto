# LL-MTPROTO  
> LL-mtproto is an abstraction-free mtproto client.

# ABOUT
ll-mtproto was developed as an answer to the mtproto clients currently existing on the opensource market, they are too complicated due to excessive abstraction layers, unfortunately these abstractions are difficult to maintain and have a strong impact on performance.

# LICESING
it must be noted that ll-mtproto is a derivative work of mtproto2json developed by @nikat, the publication of ll-mtproto under agplv3 license is possible only thanks to the approval of nikat to change the license of mtproto2json with agplv3.
